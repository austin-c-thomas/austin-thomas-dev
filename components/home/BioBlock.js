        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>I'm Austin, a full stack web developer located in Carlsbad, CA, and my talent is building things.</p>
        <p>Throughout my professional life I've built relationships with clients and customers, business plans, marketing campaigns,
        and online presences. Nowadays, I prefer to spend my time building function, aesthetic websites and applications with code.</p>
        <p>I specialize in developing full stack JavaScript applications with React/NextJS, Express, and PostgreSQL, and I have a strange
        but real obsession with writing clean CSS focused on full-responsiveness. Outside of the editor, I'm a goal-oriented team player
        with an unquenchable thirst for self-improvement who genuinely enjoys going above and beyond.</p>
